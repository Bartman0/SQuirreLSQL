SQuirreL SQL FX Change Log
==============================

Upgraded RichTextFX to version 0.6.6 and fixed the code completion problem that resulted from changes in RichTextFX, see some paragraphs below.

Bug fix: When an area of a result table was selected that exceeded valid columns, a NullPointerException occurred when any table copy function was executed.

Bug fix: File handling now remembers the last directory.

Bug fix: Fixed memory leak concerning toolbar buttons.
  Excerpt from Steven Zecks mail announcing the problem:
  "Part of the problem now is the ToolbarButtonsHandler from commit 54d130.
  I used the ActionUtils/ActionManager/ActionHandle classes to manage the rerun SQL button and action in the results tab ...
  But now when the results tab is closed and/or rerun, the _buttons list in ToolbarButtonsHandler isn't cleared, causing a memory leak."
